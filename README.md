### 💡 About Me
I’m an 18-year-old engineering student and open-source contributor based in Angola.  
I specialize in:
- Monitoring infrastructure in **constrained environments**
- Observability patterns for **unstable or intermittent networks**
- Scaling systems where traditional assumptions (like constant connectivity) don’t apply

I believe the future of infrastructure must be **globally inclusive** — that’s why I’m building tools that **don’t break when the internet does.**

### ⚡ Fun Fact
The first system I monitored was a broken router in a village school. I’ve come a long way since.
